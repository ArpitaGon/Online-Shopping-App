        <h2>About Online Shopping</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Online shopping</b> is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers. As of 2020, customers can shop online using a range of different computers and devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones. <br> <br>
            An online shop evokes the physical analogy of buying products or services at a regular "bricks-and-mortar" retailer or shopping center; the process is called business-to-consumer online shopping. When an online store is set up to enable businesses to buy from another businesses, the process is called business-to-business online shopping. A typical online store enables the customer to browse the firms range of products and services, view photos or images of the products, along with information about the product specifications, features and prices. <br> <br>
            Online stores usually enable shoppers to use "search" features to find specific models, brands or items. Online customers must have access to the Internet and a valid method of payment in order to complete a transaction, such as a credit card, an Interac-enabled debit card, or a service such as PayPal. For physical products (e.g., paperback books or clothes), the e-tailer ships the products to the customer; for digital products, such as digital audio files of songs or software, the e-tailer usually sends the file to the customer over the Internet. The largest of these online retailing corporations are Alibaba, Amazon.com, and eBay.

            <h2>Grocery Store</h2>
            <p>
                Online grocery shopping is a way of buying food and other household necessities using a web-based shopping service. There are two basic methods that people can use to purchase these items online. One is to order them from a local grocery store that participates in online shopping. A customer can then arrange for a home delivery directly from the store, or he can pick up his order at the store once an employee has assembled it. Another common practice is to order groceries from a large company, such as Amazon or Netgrocer, that will ship the items to one’s home. <br> <br>

          Online sales of fruit and vegetables have been extensively covered in reports by sectoral trade journals
and mass media all over the world. News about Amazon Fresh were unsettling as it could threaten
traditional retailers in the Western Hemisphere. Online offers are seen throughout the world and often
generate consumer excitement. Nonetheless, little has been known on the real situation in European
countries and no contextual classification of the current fruit and vegetable online sales situation has been
taken place so far.

Clothing brand marketing ideas include fashion blogging, creating unique campaigns for new releases, generating posts and/or videos for social media, and more. Regularly posting content improves your performance in search results and makes you discoverable online.
<br>

The fashion industry consists of four levels: the production of raw materials, principally fibres and textiles but also leather and fur; the production of fashion goods by designers, manufacturers, contractors, and others; retail sales; and various forms of advertising and promotion.
